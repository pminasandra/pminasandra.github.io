<h2>Mixed species trails</h2>

<p>
This was my first integrative project, where I used field-based and computational approaches to solve a problem. 
The results obtained here were summarised in my Bachelor's thesis. Supervised and funded by 
<a href="https://mariathaker.weebly.com" target="_blank">Prof Maria Thaker</a>, 
this project uses a novel and exciting way to examine animal movement. I was attacked by a bear during the fieldwork part of the project!
</p>

<p>
Animal movement decisions are complex functions of several internal and external variables. The specific effects of these variables on movement can be straightforward or complicated. Vegetation is an external variable that can affect movement in two separate  ways:
<ol>
<li>Vegetation, as food, is commonly a resource for herbivores, and acts as an attractor. Carnivores are also attracted to  vegetation, due to the increased probability of encountering prey.</li>
<li>Animals often have to move through vegetation, and thus as  an  impediment, the permeability of vegetation can negatively affect movement patterns.</li>
</ol>
The second effect of vegetation on movement has not been well studied. This thesis addresses the interplay between vegetation impermeability and animal movement using two separate approaches: fieldwork, and simulations.
</p>

<p>
In areas with dense impermeable vegetation, animals use trails to navigate. Trails are curvilinear regions with reduced or no vegetation formed by animal movement and maintained by repeated animal use. The density and geometry of trails can be used to make conclusions about animal movement. I collected trail geometry data from the edges of waterholes in an Indian forest and performed rigorous statistical analyses to test the effect of the dense impermeable thicket, Lantana camara, on animal movement patterns. I found that Lantana seems to affect trail density, but has no effect on trail geometry.
</p>

<p>
To address the converse, the effect of animal movement on vegetation spatial distribution, I programmed agent-based models of animals moving through vegetation, wherein the vegetation is not a resource but an impediment. These animals were programmed to be averse to moving to areas with higher vegetation, and their movement caused mechanical damage to vegetation. I showed that movement rules have a striking effect on the spatial distribution of vegetation. Further, I also demonstrated that the final vegetation structure was a steady state independent of the initial configuration of vegetation. Animals have been known to affect vegetation spatial structure through their actions as herbivores and seed-dispersers. However, the fact that animal movement alone can affect vegetation spatial distribution has been demonstrated here for the first time.
</p>

<p>
In all, this study demonstrates that animal movement and vegetation spatial structure are closely linked. Vegetation type and structure can affect animal space use patterns, which can consequently affect several behaviours such as predation and grouping. Animal movement alone can give rise to complexity in vegetation structure. It is likely that these two facts interact in a complex manner, and contribute as important factors to the movement decisions of animals.

<p>Varoufakis has had first-hand experience watching economies collapse—an insider
perspective, as the Greek Minister of Finance during its attempts at recovery from a catastrophic debt
crisis in 2015. In this book (the only book on economics that I’ve actually been
able to read end-to-end), he starts at the very beginning, when people became
people. Varoufakis takes us through where money and currency originated, why
banking is relevant, how stock markets emerged from the ash and smoke of the
industrial revolutions, and how bitcoins will never work as a major currency.
It’s one of the most readable popular economics books, and makes a lot of sense
out of an evolved, and ever-evolving, concept.</p>

<p>Evolved concepts are amazing—most of the pillars of our life and civilisation
that we take for granted seem to have popped out of thin air at the time
humanity stood up on two legs and looked to the skies. Where, for instance, do
these things come from—language, cities, story-telling, traditions, fashion,
art, religion? These are phenomena that have evolved with us, and the study of any
of them is infinitely fascinating and commensurately, I imagine, hard. It’s
especially hard for folks who study money, and the economy, because it’s
a subject as dry as grass before a firestorm.</p>

<p>Yanis Varoufakis’ writing has a unique tone—this book is written as
a (one-sided) conversation between a father and a daughter, where the father
attempts to explain why there is so much inequality in the world. As a result of
this framing, the style of writing is very honest and frank—not expected from
a book by an economist. Varoufakis does not hesitate to allege that economists
are more philosophers than scientists, or that commodification-driven markets
will never achieve a happier, better standard of living. When pondering about
the future, he details the various options available to us as a civilisation,
but does not shy away from the socialist option which he finds most suitable.</p>

<p>This book is definitely a must-read if you, like me, have never quite been able
to answer questions like ‘why exactly is there inflation?’, or ‘how exactly do
banks get so much money in the first place?’. Rather than the hand-wavy
analogies of Robinson Crusoe’s island or some other distant, sterile world,
Varoufakis’ chapters focus on the world as it is, and desribe why he thinks
things are the way they are. This empiricism, mixed with its honest speculative
nature, is delightful to read when applied to economics, and I would love to
read similar books on other evolved concepts as well.</p>

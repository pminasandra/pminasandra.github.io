<h2> What is this? </h2>
<p>
<em>Reviews</em> is a very old blogging initiative, staggering and barely hanging on as I have changed websites time and again.
Most of my old reviews are now gone, lost over data crashes and website deactivations and what not.
This text-only version ensures that that will never happen again.
<em>Reviews</em> is now a simple blog with not many bells and whistles. It is powered by <a href="https://jekyllrb.com" target="_BLANK">Jekyll</a>.
</p>

<p>
Here are the blog posts available now:

				<p class="blog-excerpt"><p>I have always been unsettled by Arundhati Roy’s writing.
Reading <em>The God of Small Things</em> back in college, at a time when I was beginning to find my place in India’s accursed political spectrum, was a crucial event in my life.
I was understandably a bit hesitant to pick up <em>The Ministry of Utmost Happiness</em> a few months ago.
But then, running away from issues just because they make one uncomfortable is exactly what is not needed, especially when the writing is from a famously no-nonsense person like Roy.</p>

				<p class="blog-excerpt"><p>Switching to a linux operating system and using the command-line day-to-day might seem intimidating at first.
However, not only does it open up a host of creative and career avenues, it also changes the way you interact
with your computer; ending up at a point where you finally feel in-control.
Recent experiences with many scientific projects has convinced many of my friends of how easy linux Operating Systems (OSes) can make your life.
William Shotts’ book, <em>The Linux Command Line</em>, is an excellent starting point to familiarise oneself with the shell
and start using linux software freely.</p>

			<span class="blog-date">Pranav Minasandra | 03 Mar 2020</span>
			</div>
			<div class="blogpost-box-text">
				<p class="blog-excerpt"><p>It is hard to not be completely absorbed by a paper that begins with the sentence “Imagine a circular lily pond.” 
In this seminal essay, Hamilton introduces, perhaps for the first ever time in a coherent manner, 
the idea of individualistic natural selection leading to the formation of animal groups.</p>

				<p class="blog-excerpt"><p>If someone comes up to you one fine day, when you’re strolling though a park, and starts talking to you about a book written by Steven Strogatz, 
you probably imagine something like `Non-linear Dynamics and Chaos’, Strogatz’s masterpiece that is used for teaching undergrad and grad level courses on 
dynamics everywhere. <em>Sync</em> is not such a book. <em>Sync</em> is a phenomenon in itself, a book as easily accessible to the layperson as it is unputdownable to the scientist.</p>

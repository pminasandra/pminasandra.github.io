<em>Reviews</em> is my blog.
This is a way for me to express my more random, unconnected thoughts.
Since these thoughts are always expressed alongside a book or paper I read recently, I am less likely to be talking completely unsubstantiated bunk.
I review whatever I read that I think you might also find interesting, however this must not be constituted as an endorsement of the philosophies or
beliefs of the content I am reviewing.
<em>Reviews</em> is now a simple blog with not many bells and whistles. It is powered by <a href="https://jekyllrb.com" target="_BLANK">Jekyll</a>.

Here are the blog posts available now:

        <p class="blog-excerpt"><p>Since OpenAI came out with ChatGPT last year, and especially since Elon Musk
made Twitter the favourite shouthole for a certain unique breed of humans, Artificial
Intelligence has entered the zeitgeist, and it looks like it’s here to stay for
a while. Prof Melanie Mitchell dives into AI with a perspective that lies
somewhere between historical, pedagogical, introspective, and speculative.</p>

      <div class="blogpost-box-text">
        <p class="blog-excerpt"><p>Varoufakis has had first-hand experience watching economies collapse—an insider
perspective, as the Greek Minister of Finance during its attempts at recovery from a catastrophic debt
crisis in 2015. In this book (the only book on economics that I’ve actually been
able to read end-to-end), he starts at the very beginning, when people became
people. Varoufakis takes us through where money and currency originated, why
banking is relevant, how stock markets emerged from the ash and smoke of the
industrial revolutions, and how bitcoins will never work as a major currency.
It’s one of the most readable popular economics books, and makes a lot of sense
out of an evolved, and ever-evolving, concept.</p>

        <p class="blog-excerpt"><p>What is the best kind of science?
Is it the science that is most rigorous?
The science that is most applicable?
Or maybe, some might argue, the science that is most entertaining?
I feel the best kind of science is that which is most easy to do, which requires the least equipment, and the laboratory for which is all around us.
Numbers, music, the sky, <em>language</em>… these constitute laboratory equipment accessible to everyone.</p>

        <p class="blog-excerpt"><p>I have always been unsettled by Arundhati Roy’s writing.
Reading <em>The God of Small Things</em> back in college, at a time when I was beginning to find my place in India’s accursed political spectrum, was a crucial event in my life.
I was understandably a bit hesitant to pick up <em>The Ministry of Utmost Happiness</em> a few months ago.
But then, running away from issues just because they make one uncomfortable is exactly what is not needed, especially when the writing is from a famously no-nonsense person like Roy.</p>

        <p class="blog-excerpt"><p>Switching to a linux operating system and using the command-line day-to-day might seem intimidating at first.
However, not only does it open up a host of creative and career avenues, it also changes the way you interact
with your computer; ending up at a point where you finally feel in-control.
Recent experiences with many scientific projects has convinced many of my friends of how easy linux Operating Systems (OSes) can make your life.
William Shotts’ book, <em>The Linux Command Line</em>, is an excellent starting point to familiarise oneself with the shell
and start using linux software freely.</p>

you probably imagine something like `Non-linear Dynamics and Chaos’, Strogatz’s masterpiece that is used for teaching undergrad and grad level courses on 
dynamics everywhere. <em>Sync</em> is not such a book. <em>Sync</em> is a phenomenon in itself, a book as easily accessible to the layperson as it is unputdownable to the scientist.</p>

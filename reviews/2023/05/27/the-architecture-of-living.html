<p>It’s surprising how much connects the <a href="http://www.chialvo.net/Curso/Cordoba2005/ClasesPowerpoints/Presentacion9/PapersClase9/soc2.pdf">dynamics</a> and the <a href="https://epubs.siam.org/doi/pdf/10.1137/070710111">statics</a> of
all kinds of real world systems.
For years now, we have been trying our best to get at why—why do <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1574008004800105">cities</a>,
<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0019103504003811">asteroids</a>,

<a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.108.208102">neuronal
avalanches</a>,
and <a href="/haha">behavioural transitions</a> all follow the same distributions as well?
What connects general, universal phenomena like regime shifts, chaos, and
<a href="https://pminasandra.github.io/reviews/2020/01/19/sync-by-steven-strogatz.html">synchronisation</a>?</p>

<p>The story of the study of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_system">complex
systems</a> is the story of science
itself. We take knowledge gained from several sources, we tie it all
together, and we try to create understanding. I feel we are, right now, in the
‘describing things’ part of science. We first need to describe things properly
before we can understand why those things are the way they are.</p>

<p>Herbert Simon’s <em>The Architecture of Complexity</em> is an old book chapter
published in 1967, only years after the structure of DNA was discovered, and
<em>before</em> man’s landing on the moon. It is astonishing how much this field had
already advanced back then. This is just the feeling I got when someone told me
the back-propagation algorithm for optimising neural networks was already
a thing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backpropagation#History">fifty years
ago</a>.</p>

<p>Simon talks about a variety of things in <em>Architecture</em>, but the limelight is
given to hierarchy. Most systems in science, such as societies, biological
entities, materials, and in a sense, the universe itself, are all hierarchical.
A hierarchical system, the way Simon defines it, is something that can
recursively be decomposed into groups of entities, wherein interactions within
each group exceed the interactions among groups. Such systems, pervasive in
nature, have unique properties that Simon begins to explore.</p>

<p>For instance, hierarchical systems are resilient. Human beings don’t fall
apart when you disconnect a few atoms from each other. This stability comes from
multiple layer’s of fail-safes: A few atoms falling apart might cause a cell to
fail, a few tissues need to fail for the organ to malfunction, and lots of
terrible things need to happen for a person, or a machine, or a society, or an
empire, to cease to function. Simon argues that complex systems tend to be
hierarchical. He also explores the link between how much a system can be
decomposed into constituents, and its comprehensibility. Standing somewhere
between science and philosophy, this 20-page chapter is an easy, mind-blowing
read.</p>

<p>I, like many, am tired of the relentless jargon of academic writing. If I want
to say that $A$ doesn’t make sense, I need to write “While efforts have been
made to understand the dynamics [36] and drivers [37-40] of $A$, literature on
explaining $A$ causally are sparse” (or something else that makes me sound like
an old rich man in an armchair). In this sea of pretentious writing, Simon’s
essay, full of delightful parables, fun thought experiments, and interesting
analogies is, maybe not an island, but a beach? Or would it be a grain of sand
on that beach? Or an atom of silicon within that grain?…</p>

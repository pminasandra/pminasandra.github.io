<p><em>Disclaimer: This piece was written after reading plenty of material, and
losing plenty of friends to Mr. Ravi Shankar’s cult.
We do not intend to hurt anyone, and thus are not liable for hurt feelings,
misaligned cosmic vibrations, or other unwanted experiences that you might

<p>Sri Sri Ravi Shankar, who we will refer to as Mr. Ravi Shankar, is an
internationally popular Indian god-man, and the leader of the <em>Art
of Living</em> foundation. 
Mr. Ravi Shankar boasts an impressive record of awards for his humanitarian
peacekeeping and his promotion of <em>yoga</em>.
Mr. Ravi Shankar is also probably best known for being a common subject of various
posters in elite institutions, where he often appears mysteriously to deliver
talks, where he frequently does not take un-screened questions.
Why is Ravi Shankar invited to deliver these talks?
How does he access such institutions?
What makes him a worldwide phenomenon, and who are his followers?
Here, we argue that Ravi Shankar’s large following is bad news, propagating harmful
pseudoscientific misinformation, displaying cult-like tendencies, and involving
itself subtly in sensitive Indian and global politics.
In the modern world, where lines of war are rapidly being drawn in a polarised
world population, lending a platform to such a man can prove very costly in the
long run.</p>

<h2 id="pseudoscience-and-misinformation">Pseudoscience and misinformation</h2>
<p>The main selling-point of Mr. Ravi Shankar’s talks and events is his trademark
breathing technique, <em>Sudarshan Kriya</em>, an insight he says he has been granted, and
which he now teaches to people at sometimes exorbitant prices.
As eyebrow-raising as the phrase ‘trademark breathing technique’ might be, his
legions of followers all swear by it, and there seem to be, at first glance,
numerous research articles in peer-reviewed journals that attribute it miraculous
powers.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0tX0M6EveGY/maxresdefault.jpg" alt="A poster about Sudarshan Kriya" /></p>

<p>How reliable are these publications?
Consider <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3573542/">this</a> one.
This paper by Zope &amp; Zope (2013) provides a ‘review’ of the various
almost-magical powers attributed to this <em>cyclical</em> breathing technique. They
claim there are physiological, neurological, and endocrine benefits among
others. Are Zope and Zope impartial authors and researchers? The <em>Conflict of
Interest</em> section in the article says simply “None declared”.
Where do these esteemed researchers work?
The first Zope is affiliated to the <em>Department of Periodontology, Maharashtra
Institute of Dental Science and Research, Vishvnathpuram, Latur</em>.
While this man’s affiliation to a dental institute does not lend great credence
to his work on a breathing technique, the affiliation of the second author is
far more interesting.
The second Zope  works at the <em>Out-patient Department, Sri Sri Ayurveda 
Trust, The Art of Living International Campus, Udaypura, Bangalore</em>. 
How, then, is there no conflict of interest?</p>

<p>Not all research about <em>Sudarshan Kriya</em> is done by Zopes associated with the
Art of Living foundation.
<a href="https://www.yoga-als-therapie.de/assets/Studien/Downloads/Brown-2005a-j-compl-altern-med.pdf">This</a>
paper is written by Brown &amp; Gerbarg (2005).
They proudly say in the acknowledgements that
“Neither Dr. Richard P. Brown nor Dr. Patricia L. Gerbarg receives any form of financial benefit from the Art of
Living Foundation, a non-profit organization and UN-affiliated NGO.”
Is this research then reliable?
Brown and Gerbarg both seem to be affiliated with something called
BREATH-BODY-MIND. They say “We hope to increase awareness of the Healing Power
of the Breath using BREATH-BODY-MIND™ to enhance physical and mental health.”
This organisation, composed only of these two authors, seems to be dedicated to
establishing breathing techniques as equals of conventional
scientific medical approaches. 
In a world swamped with alternative medicine claims, such as homeopathy,
ayurveda, and crystal healing, this institute is also dedicated to the spread of
harmful misinformation, no matter how good the intentions.
We are going to ignore the suspicious, password-protected “<a href="https://www.breath-body-mind.com/military-resources">Military
Resources</a>”
section at the bottom of their <a href="https://www.breath-body-mind.com/">website</a>.</p>

<p>We admit that not all research about this breathing technique is flawed based on
its authors. Some <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022399907002772">research</a> even comes from the All India Institute of Medical
Sciences (although in the acknowledgements, we do see “This work was carried out
in collaboration with Ved Vigyan Mahavidyapeeth. We acknowledge them for their
support and the active participation of Delhi chapter of Art of Living.
Financial support was provided by Indian Systems of Medicine and Homeopathy”).
Maybe there is truly credible research supporting such a technique. However,
like we have shown, a considerable amount of this research, which Ravi Shankar
routinely points to in order to establish his techniques as ‘scientific’, is riddled
with scientific corruption and misinformation.
Even the journals where some of these papers are published have tarnished
reputations.
The BREATH-BODY-MIND authors published in the Journal of Alternative and
Complementary Medicine, which
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journal_of_Alternative_and_Complementary_Medicine">Wikipedia</a>
describes as  “quite ludicrous”, and says
“papers like this do not add to human knowledge, they detract from it”.</p>

<p>These so-called research articles lend Ravi Shankar something very crucial,
which he very much covets: legitimacy. A recurring theme is Ravi Shankar’s
brilliant <em>modus operandi</em>, squeezing every drop of legitimacy out of every
research article, every talk, and every public appearance in an esteemed
institute, and then using it to promote further talks and further such research. 
This is a particularly vicious cycle. Unknowingly, many institutes fall prey to
this scheme, and the man cunningly leverages the little legitimacy he gains,
moving on to the next event.
This marketing strategy ensures that many organisations, some as important as
the Indian Institute of Science, <a href="https://thewire.in/education/iisc-students-protest-sri-sri-talk-on-campus-for-unscientific-views">invite</a> Ravi Shankar to help with mental
health crises (where he was mercilessly opposed, but to no avail).</p>

<p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.srisriravishankar.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Gurudev-in-Aachen-May-2023.jpeg?w=940&amp;ssl=1" alt="Ravi Shankar in
Aachen" />.</p>

<p>Yet another type of pseudoscience that Ravi Shankar propagates, like many of his
spiritual compatriots, is nonsense cosmology and nonsense science generally,
which might even seem harmless at first glance. Consider
<a href="https://wisdom.srisriravishankar.org/universe-is-field-of-consciousness/">this</a>
article, where Ravi Shankar (or some ghostwriter for the organisation) claims
that “Everything in this creation has certain vibrations. Each animal is
connected to the macrocosm and brings down a particular type of cosmic ray into
the planet, that manifests particular vibrations.” This vibration nonsense is
all-pervading: everyone has some aunt, some grandfather, some teacher, someone
who spouts the life-is-quantum-vibrations theory. Where did it come from? It
seems to originate from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Thought">New
Thought</a>, and must have been enforced
further in the atomic era as the western bloc explored physics at breakneck
speeds in pursuit of the next atom bomb, while the soviets delved deep into
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1977/06/19/archives/emigre-tells-of-research-in-soviet-in-parapsychology-for-military.html">psychic
research</a> nonsense.
Every corporate Indian guru (at least, the kind that plays their pipes for an educated
audience) re-amplifies this—for lack of a better term—bullshit.</p>

<p>Why is the idea of life- or mind-as-vibrations so popular?
We argue that it is a symptom of a terrible lack of good scientific
communication: where most of the population heard about the new physics fads
that had then invaded the <em>zeitgeist</em>:
particles, string theory, etc., but the details were never accessible to them.
A particularly interesting case is the Indian populace, mired deep in the
<em>Guru-Shishya</em> (teacher-student) relationship where the teacher is revered as
god. Such a population has turned to gurus to satisfy their need for knowledge,
and the gurus, most of whom are ill-educated (Ravi Shankar seems to hold
a Bachelor’s degree in science, we are mentioning this just so that the
information is complete) spread this nonsense which then takes deep root in
society.
In a polarised society where trust in science is vanishing like breath on
a mirror, these gurus have become the source of ultimate truth for all of their
followers. It is a tricky situation, and one which should not further be
encouraged.</p>

<h2 id="mr-ravi-shankars-cult">Mr. Ravi Shankar’s cult</h2>
<p>When thousands of members around the world, all deeply influenced by
<em>Guru-Shishya</em> thought, devote themselves to  Ravi Shankar and treat his words
as truth and law, his followers seem more and more like a large multi-national
cult.</p>

<p>How are cults characterised?
Paraphrasing Wikipedia,
a cult is a group which is typically led by a charismatic and self-appointed 
leader, who excessively controls its members, requiring unwavering devotion 
to a set of beliefs and practices which are considered deviant.
Does a typical follower of Ravi Shankar seem like a cultist?
It is difficult to make literature-informed arguments here (but see
<a href="https://thewire.in/religion/keep-god-and-godmen-out-of-politics-and-river-beds">this</a>), so some of our
arguments will be anecdotal.</p>

<h3 id="a-charismatic-and-self-appointed-leader-who-receives-unwavering-devotion">A charismatic and self-appointed leader who receives unwavering devotion</h3>
<p>Do yourselves a favour, and visit Ravi Shankar’s <a href="https://www.srisriravishankar.org/">website</a>.
<a href="https://www.narendramodi.in/">Few other public figures</a> have as many pictures
of themselves on their websites.
This is because Ravi Shankar’s following is held together solely by his persona,
and not much else.
Our interactions with our friends who ended up in the Art of Living and now work
for the organisation have shown us that their leader, Ravi Shankar, holds the
central position of a demigod in their lives. Art of Living members greet each other with the
phrase “Jai Gurudev”, or “Victory to the Teacher God”, referring to Ravi Shankar. They spend an inordinate
amount of time preaching Art of Living philosophies and practices, all the time
believing that they are doing good in the world.</p>

<h3 id="a-set-of-beliefs-and-practices-which-are-considered-deviant">A set of beliefs and practices which are considered deviant</h3>
<p>Art of Living members seem to be identified by both, an utter and complete
devotion to Ravi Shankar, as well as their strong belief in their way of life,
which they consider superior to alternatives. Great importance is given to
meditation, prayer, and <em>satsang</em> (meeting other devotees). Members also
dedicate great time to spreading Art of Living thought, and organise various
recruitment activities, including talks at reputed institutes and universities.
This specific aspect of recruitment—the targeting of university
students—leads to Ravi Shankar’s followers being those who are well-educated
and often people in positions of power and influence. As a result, Ravi Shankar
is very well-connected, and revered by often very powerful people.</p>

<p>Two examples are sufficient to drive home the cult-like tendencies of the Art of
Living. First, Ravi Shankar’s devotees are hell-bent upon getting him a Nobel
Peace Prize, something he
<a href="http://artoflivingfree.blogspot.com/2010/04/ravishankars-hankering-for-nobel-peace.html?m=1">allegedly</a> doggedly craves.
The second is a more personal example.
A dear friend of both the authors, a clever man with a Master’s degree in
chemistry, who specialised in computational chemistry and published his thesis
at the Indian Institute of Science, fell prey to the machinations of the Art of
Living. This well-educated man, after joining the cult, eventually began to
speak Art-of-Living drivel, claiming that prehistoric India was an idyllic,
matriarchal, violence-free land without caste and prejudice. While such dreams
might seem attractive, these claims contradict known history as well as logic.</p>

<h2 id="the-politics-of-living">The Politics of Living</h2>
<p>As already established, Ravi Shankar wields great influence over his followers
and their associates. Naturally, he can influence their political views and
ideologies. What political opinions does Ravi Shankar harbour and publicise? At
face value, it would seem that Ravi Shankar does not exclusively support any
single political ideology. However some of his opinions become apparent from his
public political commentary.</p>

<p>As an Indian guru, Ravi Shankar’s political comments are largely Indo-centric.
India is a diverse country, and has recently become divided on communal lines.
Various minorities are subjected to violence and are being increasingly
ostracised by the ruling party. Opposition to these happenings is through
protests and strikes by the masses and competition by opposing political
parties. Ravi Shankar seems to prefer an obedient, non-confrontational, and
conformist population. He also recommends that regional political parties steer
clear of national politics,
<a href="https://www.srisriravishankar.org/blog/post/layers-of-democracy/">saying</a>
“Regional parties who try to play a national
role create havoc and more hurdles for good governance because their vision
remains limited”. He also
<a href="https://www.srisriravishankar.org/blog/peace/government-schemes-and-protests/">urges</a>
Indian citizens not to oppose government decisions. To quote Ravi Shankar, “I
will appeal to young people not to go on a strike like this. This is not going
to help you or the nation”. He also portrays Indian political protests as
generally violent and destructive, and also portrays the participants as
ignorant of what they are protesting against. This is downright false. Such
propaganda by Ravi Shankar influences the minds of many and has no place near
any educational institution.</p>

<p>Ravi Shankar is a controversial figure.
He <a href="https://www.firstpost.com/politics/sri-sri-ravi-shankar-to-mediate-ayodhya-case-his-remarks-on-babri-masjid-dispute-epitomise-art-of-fanning-fear-4383901.html">was
part</a> of the court-appointed committee which ruled unjustly and unfairly
against victims of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demolition_of_the_Babri_Masjid">Babri Masjid case</a>.
In this case, a mosque was destroyed by a large Hindu mob, spurred by actions of
the now-ruling party of India. It is unclear why Ravi Shankar, the head of
a Hindu-leaning organisation, was a committee member in this case. 
His involvement in the pollution of the Yamuna river, and his <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ngt-holds-sri-sris-art-of-living-responsible-for-damaging-yamuna-floodplains/article61848009.ece">subsequent
indictment</a> but his punishment with a laughably low fine highlight his political
connections. When the government of India came up with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_Amendment_Act_protests">two draconic laws</a> to, in
effect, threaten the citizenship of Muslim Indians, Ravi Shankar <a href="https://www.timesnownews.com/india/article/sri-sri-ravi-shankar-hails-caa-at-times-now-summit-says-persecuted-pakistani-muslims-should-also-be-welcomed/552931">came
out</a>
in support of these laws.
His self-portrayal as a politically neutral figure resonates with
his following, who thus largely side with the current, increasingly totalitarian
government of India and see no wrong in them. This is dangerous, and harmful to
many Indians who are victims of this government.
His presence at various institutes could influence the political ideologies of
Indian and other students towards the right, which can be alarming in certain
contexts.</p>

<h2 id="a-plague-of-gurus">A plague of gurus</h2>

<p>Ravi Shankar is only one among a growing number of celebrity spiritual leaders,
who preach new-age Hindu ideology, mostly centred around <em>yoga</em>, prayer,
meditation, wisdom, vibrations of the cosmos, and other such concepts. These
gurus, such as Jaggi Vasudev and Baba Ramdev, are all uber-rich popular figures,
largely in support of the government of India. All these gurus are also avid
spreaders of misinformation, albeit misinformation unique to their own styles.
Such gurus are contradictory in a religion that expects its leaders to live
a frugal and ascetic life in pursuit of truth.</p>

<p>Ravi Shankar’s strategy is probably unique. He mainly garners support from
younger people, mostly university students and recent graduates. He is, like we
say before, a clever man who plays his cards close to the chest. However, upon
closer examination, we see striking and alarming patterns: A tendency to be the
centre of a variety of pseudoscience and scientific fraud, a central role in
a large cult-like organisation that grants him significant power, and
a belief in a conformist, conflict-free ideology where the populace agrees and cooperates
completely and unquestioningly with the government.</p>

<p>Educational institutes are meant to be hotspots of debate, learning, and pursuit of truth.
The presence of such a figure in an educational institute is questionable at best,
and harmful at worst. This is why it is a very bad idea to invite Sri Sri Ravi
Shankar to speak at your institute.</p>

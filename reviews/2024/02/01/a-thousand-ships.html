<p>Wrath! Sing, Goddess, of the wrath of Achilles, Peleus’ Son,
whose wrath brought on the Achaians innumerable woes,
hurled down into Hades countless brave men’s souls
while leaving their bodies to dogs and carrion crows.
And who will sing of the fate of the women of Troy and Greece?</p>

<p>Despite the horrendous discourse surrounding most matters related to ancient
Greece, particularly from a section of internet-dwellers who believe that white
people invented culture, the great tragedy that is the myth of the Trojan war is
a fiction writer’s treasure. Well, to be fair, writers and creative-types seem
to love myths: how perfect a set up! The world has done your world-building for
you, you get to do the more delicious stuff—the interpersonal conflicts, the
reinterpretations, the soliloquies. One of the problems with myths, though, is
that historically these stories have been told by, and to, men. The stories of
women in myths are often relegated to the backdrop. Why is the story of Orestes,
and not Clytemnestra? Why is it the story of <em>Rama</em> and not of
<a href="https://www.outlookindia.com/national/sitayana-mallika-sengupta-s-rewriting-of-ramayana-as-sita-story-news-227275" target="_blank"><em>Sita</em></a>? Most strikingly, why is the protagonist of the Mahabharata not
<em>Draupadi</em>, who as a character drives most of the war of <em>Kurukshetra</em>?</p>

<p>Natalie Haynes illustrates the depth of this problem by tackling the part of the
Trojan war covered by the Iliad and the Odyssey: the burning of Troy, the death
of Achilles, Odysseyus’ journey back to Ithaca. She also explores what is often
ignored—the fates of Helen, Hecuba, Cassandra, Andromache, and many other
women who drive much of this story. Haynes spares not even the gods—the
dropping of the golden apple, the battle of the three goddesses, the dance of
the Erinyes, the ‘madness’ of Clytemnestra; Haynes does justice to them all.</p>

<p>This is a very touching and moving book, but it probably won’t hit as hard if
you are not already at least somewhat familiar with this mythology. There’s an
amazing YouTube channel called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@OverlySarcasticProductions" target="_blank">Overly Sarcastic Productions</a> for knowing more about this and
other mythologies, histories, writing tropes, and a lot more. I thoroughly
recommend bingeing it. About <em>A Thousand Ships</em> this is all I have to
say: by the end, Natalie Haynes had me in tears.</p>

<p>Where did language come from? Did Neanderthals speak like we do?
What makes a language anyway? Why are <em>we</em> the only ones among all the
primates that have the ability to speak? And does it really make a difference?</p>

<p>Mithen’s book is intended for academics. It is not an academic book, but is best
read with someone used to thinking very critically of what they read, paying
attention to citations, and forming their own opinions in real time. The book is
amazingly concise (although it weighs more than a kilogram) given the breadth of
topics it has to cover. Mithen speaks (heh) about the evolution of humans, their
phylogeny, tool use, discovery and use of fire, and their vocal and cerebral
anatomies in comparison with other primates and other extinct hominids. He also
talks about the genetic aspects of language, the evolution of words, and the
structure of syntax. This book offers a lot to ponder over, and is thus a nice
and slow read.</p>

<p>One criticism I have of this book is that not enough attention is paid to
a bunch of literature I would have thought was relevant: information-theoretic
investigations of language, the construction of language models and NLP, and the
vast corpus of literature surrounding calls and their uses in non-primates.</p>

<p>I strongly recommend reading this book. It is intensely engaging, and does not
patronise or equivocate unnecessarily. This is <em>the</em> readers’ book for
knowing about language.</p>

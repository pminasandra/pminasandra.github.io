<h2>Career</h2>
<p>
I am a PhD candidate at the <a href="https://ab.mpg.de">Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavior</a>, Konstanz, Germany.
I am strongly inclined towards <a href="projects/">research</a> that demand 
combined computational, theoretical, and data-driven approaches.
My PhD focuses on behavioural influence in social groups at different time-scales, and I address these questions theoretically, as well as using data from different model organisms. 
</p>

<p>
My Master's and Bachelor's degrees in Biology were awarded in 2020 by the Indian Institute of Science.
All my pre-PhD research was in collective behaviour and animal movement, carried out in affiliation with various groups
at the <a href="http://ces.iisc.ac.in" target="_blank">Centre for Ecological Sciences</a>. 
During this time, I worked on four 
highly quantitative projects. I have also taken numerous courses relevant to quantitative biology, 
and was a Teaching Assistant for the course <em>Quantitative Ecology: Research Design and Inference</em> at CES in 2019.</p>

<section id="about-life">
<h2>Life</h2>
<p>
I am extremely interested in reading really old classic books and papers in various fields, to get a picture of science and society decades or centuries ago.
Firmly adherent to the fact that science does not happen in a vaccuum, and in the (probably naive) hope that things can be better, I am a vocal and harsh critic of academia.
I am also committed to free and open source software, and attempt to use only such software in my life and research.
</p>

<p>
On a more light-hearted note, 
I am also an avid fan of all types of classical music, 
including but not limited to western, carnatic, and islamic. I have made attempts at playing the flute, 
and drawing whiteboard art, and am passably good at them.
I write both humorous as well as serious satire for various issues.
I have established and organised several academic and 
non-academic events, some more successful than others. These include the lecture series 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCi6_pDmCVXntKN5Ei80oTsnkaEoGmqsw" target="_blank">Umwelten IISc</a>, 
the UG Theoretical Biology Circle, and the CES Shut-Up-and-Write circle, among several others</p>

<h2>Funding</h2>
<p>
I am grateful to have been a fellow of the Indian Government's <a href="http://kvpy.iisc.ac.in" target="_blank"><em>Kishore Vaigyanik Protsahan Yojana</em></a>,
which gave me financial freedom at a very early age.
<strike>I strongly recommend applying to this scholarhip if you're an Indian highschooler.</strike>
The Indian Government has recently closed this fellowship in what can only be described, in polite terms, as a puzzling move.
<a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/bengaluru-scrapping-aptitude-test-may-hinder-pure-science-dreams/articleshow/92991686.cms" target="_BLANK">I stand by</a> the thousands of former awardees of this fellowship who have excoriated this decision.

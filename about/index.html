<h2>Academics</h2>
<p>
My Master's and Bachelor's degrees in Biology were awarded in 2020 by the Indian Institute of Science,
and by October 2020 I should have joined the <a href="https://orn.mpg.de/IMPRS/" target="_blank">IMPRS for Organismal Biology</a>,
where I will be studying synchronisation in social animals.
So far, my research has been in collective behaviour and animal movement, carried out in affiliation with various groups 
at the <a href="http://ces.iisc.ac.in" target="_blank">Centre for Ecological Sciences</a> and other places. I am strongly inclined towards questions that demand combined 
computational, theoretical, and data-driven approaches. In this direction, I have worked on four 
highly quantitative <a href="/projects">projects</a>. I have also taken numerous courses relevant to quantitative biology, 
and was a Teaching Assistant for the course Quantitative Ecology: Research Design and Inference at CES.</p>

<h2>Life</h2>
<p>
I am extremely interested in reading old classic books and papers in various fields. 
I like using programming languages in unique and interesting ways â€“ e.g. I have a diary made in LaTeX, 
wherein the LaTeX code was generated using a python code; I send e-mails using a command-line utility 
I programmed, and do all other manners of weird stuff. I am also an avid fan of all types of classical music, 
including but not limited to western, carnatic, and islamic. I have made attempts at playing the flute, 
and drawing whiteboard art, and am passably good at them. I have established and organised several academic and 
non-academic events, some more successful than others. These include the lecture series 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCi6_pDmCVXntKN5Ei80oTsnkaEoGmqsw" target="_blank">Umwelten IISc</a>, 
the UG Theoretical Biology Circle, and the CES Shut-Up-and-Write circle, among several others</p>

<h2>Funding</h2>
<p>
I am grateful to have been a fellow of the Indian Government's <a href="https://kvpy.iisc.ernet.in" target="_blank"><em>Kishore Vaigyanik Protsahan Yojana</em></a>,
which gave me financial freedom at a very early age. I strongly recommend applying to this scholarhip if you're an Indian highschooler.

My proposal to the IMPRS for Organismal Biology was selected for funding under the <a href="https://www.daad.de/en/information-services-for-higher-education-institutions/further-information-on-daad-programmes/gssp/"
target="_blank">DAAD Graduate Student Scholarship Programme</a>, and I have accepted this funding to complete my PhD at Konstanz.

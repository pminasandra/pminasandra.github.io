<h2>Blackbuck collective behaviour</h2>

<p>
"Quantifying and understanding group size distributions can be useful for 
understanding group behaviour in animal populations. 
We analysed group size data of the blackbuck, <em>Antilope cervicapra</em>, from six different 
field sites to estimate the group size distribution of this antelope. We used likelihood based 
methods (AICs and likelihood ratios) to show that an exponentially truncated power-law is 
the distribution that best describes blackbuck group data, outperforming a simple power-law, 
an exponential distribution, and a lognormal distribution. Our results show that distribution parameters 
can be used to draw novel insights regarding group dynamics, and we demonstrate this by investigating 
how habitat openness affects group size distributions."</p>

<p>
That's the abstract of the paper, anyway.
Under the guidance of 
<a href="https://isvaranlab.weebly.com" target="_blank">Prof Kavita Isvaran</a>, 
I led this project at every step of the research process except for the collection of primary data. 
This data about blackbuck group sizes was collected by Kavita during her PhD, and remains one of the 
most fascinating datasets I have dealt with so far. The median group size in some cases is 1, but 
there are often groups of several hundred blackbuck! I show that, in six different blackbuck populations 
from all over the Indian subcontinent, the same distribution of group size holds. This distribution is 
`heavy-tailed', in the sense that it permits the frequent occurence of very large groups (at least 
compared to most usual distributions). This has a lot of important implications when we consider 
previously established literature, and so, Kavita and I decided to submit this manuscript to <em>Behaviour</em>. 
The manuscript came a long way since I first wrote it in 2018 
(you can read the old version of it on 
<a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/411199v1.abstract" target="_blank">BioRxiv</a> 
or the version accepted and 
<a href="https://brill.com/view/journals/beh/157/6/article-p541_3.xml?language=en" target="_blank">published</a> 
by Behaviour) and was my first foray into serious academic writing.</p>

Beyond what is covered in the manuscript, this project was also fun because of the completely exploratory 
nature of what is going on here: I tried agent-based models, random and wonky approaches to group size 
modelling, and what not. There is a lot more to do here, so Kavita and I have started working a UG Student,
Yukta Thyagaraj, a UG student at IISc, to understand group size distributions from a phylogenetic perspective.

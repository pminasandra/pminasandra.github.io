I"<p>“Quantifying and understanding group size distributions can be useful for
understanding group behaviour in animal populations. We analysed group size data
of the blackbuck, <em>Antilope cervicapra</em>, from six different field sites to
estimate the group size distribution of this antelope. We used likelihood based
methods (AICs and likelihood ratios) to show that an exponentially truncated
power-law is the distribution that best describes blackbuck group data,
outperforming a simple power-law, an exponential distribution, and a lognormal
distribution. Our results show that distribution parameters can be used to draw
novel insights regarding group dynamics, and we demonstrate this by
investigating how habitat openness affects group size distributions.”</p>

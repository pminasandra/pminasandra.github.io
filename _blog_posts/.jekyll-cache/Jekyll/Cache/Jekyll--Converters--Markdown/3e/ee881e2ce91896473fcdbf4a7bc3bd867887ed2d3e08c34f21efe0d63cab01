I"e<p>Switching to a linux operating system and using the command-line day-to-day might seem intimidating at first.
However, not only does it open up a host of creative and career avenues, it also changes the way you interact
with your computer; ending up at a point where you finally feel in-control.
Recent experiences with many scientific projects has convinced many of my friends of how easy linux Operating Systems (OSes) can make your life.
William Shottsâ€™ book, <em>The Linux Command Line</em>, is an excellent starting point to familiarise oneself with the shell
and start using linux software freely.</p>

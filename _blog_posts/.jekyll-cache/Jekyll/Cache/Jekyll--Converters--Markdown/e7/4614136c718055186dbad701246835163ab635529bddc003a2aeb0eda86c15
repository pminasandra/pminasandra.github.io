I"ð<p>If someone comes up to you one fine day, when youâ€™re strolling though a park, and starts talking to you about a book written by Steven Strogatz, 
you probably imagine something like `Non-linear Dynamics and Chaosâ€™, Strogatzâ€™s masterpiece that is used for teaching undergrad and grad level courses on 
dynamics everywhere. <em>Sync</em> is not such a book. <em>Sync</em> is a phenomenon in itself, a book as easily accessible to the layperson as it is unputdownable to the scientist.</p>

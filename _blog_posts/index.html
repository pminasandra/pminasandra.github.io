<h2> What is this? </h2>
<p>
<em>Reviews</em> is a very old blogging initiative, staggering and barely hanging on as I have changed websites time and again.
Most of my old reviews are now gone, lost over data crashes and website deactivations and what not.
This text-only version ensures that that will never happen again.
<em>Reviews</em> is now a simple blog with not many bells and whistles. It is powered by <a href="https://jekyllrb.com" target="_BLANK">Jekyll</a>.
</p>

<p>
Here are the blog posts available now:
</p>

<div class="all-blog-posts">
	{% for post in site.posts %}
		<div class="blogpost-box">
			<div class="some-container">
			<span class="blog-title"><p><a href="{{ site.url }}{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a></p></span>
			<span class="blog-date">{{ post.author }} | {{ post.date | date_to_string}}</span>
			</div>
			<div class="blogpost-box-text">
				<p class="blog-excerpt">{{ post.excerpt }}</p>

				 <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ post.url }}" class="readmore">Read more...</a>
			</div>
			<div class="blogpost-box-image">
				<img src="{{ post.img }}">
			</div>
		</div>
	{% endfor %}
</div>

<em>Reviews</em> is my blog.
This is a way for me to express my more random, unconnected thoughts.
Since these thoughts are always expressed alongside a book or paper I read recently, I am less likely to be talking completely unsubstantiated bunk.
I review whatever I read that I think you might also find interesting, however this must not be constituted as an endorsement of the philosophies or
beliefs of the content I am reviewing.
<em>Reviews</em> is now a simple blog with not many bells and whistles. It is powered by <a href="https://jekyllrb.com" target="_BLANK">Jekyll</a>.

Here are the blog posts available now:

<div class="all-blog-posts">
  {% assign post_counter = 0 %}
  {% for post in site.posts %}
    {% assign post_counter = post_counter | plus: 1 %}
    <div class="blogpost-box{% if post_counter > 3 %} initial-hidden hidden{% endif %}">
      <div class="some-container">
        <span class="blog-title"><p><a href="{{ site.url }}{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a></p></span>
        <span class="blog-date">{{ post.author }} | {{ post.date | date_to_string }}</span>
      </div>
      <div class="blogpost-box-text">
        <p class="blog-excerpt">{{ post.excerpt }}</p>
        <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ post.url }}" class="readmore">Read more...</a>
      </div>
      <div class="blogpost-box-image">

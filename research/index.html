All animals behave. By that, I mean that all animals constantly switch between more-or-less distinct behavioural states.
Behaviour helps animals tolerate heterogeneity and unpredictability in the environment.
Are there common structural patterns that appear in the behavioural sequences of all animals?
Using accelerometer-inferred, long, continuous behavioural sequences from three animal species, I showed some shared principles
in the behavioural sequences of three animal species.

<p>
Different behavioural decisions are made at different time-scales.
Going forward, I will also look at what time-scales are relevant to behaviour, and how those time-scales interact.
I will also examine what combination of decision-making time-scales is optimal for animals.

<p>
Animals live in a stunning variety of societies, ranging from freely composed herds to rigid social groups, and even solitary species.
What principles create this variation in social structures?
Are the driving forces of sociality very different across species, or can one model explain this variation?
</p>

<p>
What factors decide the nature of social interactions within a group?
How do individuals interact and influence each other?
Can we infer fine-scale group interactions from long-scale patterns?

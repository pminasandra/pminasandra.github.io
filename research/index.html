<p>
All animals behave. By that, I mean that all animals constantly switch between more-or-less distinct behavioural states.
Behaviour helps animals tolerate heterogeneity and unpredictability in the environment.
Are there common structural patterns that appear in the behavioural sequences of all animals?
Using accelerometer-inferred, long, continuous behavioural sequences from three animal species, I showed some shared principles
in the behavioural sequences of three animal species.

<p>
Different behavioural decisions are made at different time-scales.
Going forward, I will also look at what time-scales are relevant to behaviour, and how those time-scales interact.
I will also examine what combination of decision-making time-scales is optimal for animals.

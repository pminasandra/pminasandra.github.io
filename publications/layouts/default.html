<p>“Quantifying and understanding group size distributions can be useful for
understanding group behaviour in animal populations. We analysed group size data
of the blackbuck, <em>Antilope cervicapra</em>, from six different field sites to
estimate the group size distribution of this antelope. We used likelihood based
methods (AICs and likelihood ratios) to show that an exponentially truncated
power-law is the distribution that best describes blackbuck group data,
outperforming a simple power-law, an exponential distribution, and a lognormal
distribution. Our results show that distribution parameters can be used to draw
novel insights regarding group dynamics, and we demonstrate this by
investigating how habitat openness affects group size distributions.”</p>

<p>This data about blackbuck group sizes was collected by Kavita during her PhD,
and remains one of the most fascinating datasets I have dealt with so far. The
median group size in some cases is 1, but there are often groups of several
hundred blackbuck! I show that, in six different blackbuck populations from all
over the Indian subcontinent, the same distribution of group size holds. This
distribution is ‘heavy-tailed’, in the sense that it permits the frequent
occurrence of very large groups (at least compared to most usual distributions).
It is also difficult to characterise a single ‘typical’ group size for such
populations.
This result has a lot of important implications when we consider previously established
literature, and so, Kavita and I decided to submit this manuscript to Behaviour.
The manuscript came a long way since I first wrote it in 2018 (you can read the
old version of it on BioRxiv or the version accepted and published by Behaviour)
and was my first foray into serious academic writing.</p>

<p>Beyond what is covered in the manuscript, this project was also fun because of
the completely exploratory nature of what is going on here: I tried agent-based
models, random and wonky approaches to group size modelling, and what not.</p>

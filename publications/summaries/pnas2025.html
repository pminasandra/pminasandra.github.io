Are there widespread statistical properties in the dynamics of animal behavior?
I led a cross-species project addressing this question with meerkats, coatis,
and hyenas. Our study uncovered unexpected statistical similarities in animal
behaviors across diverse contexts, individual animals, and even entirely
different species. The study also delves into various intriguing results,
methods, and simulations, and in trying to explain the phenomena we found,
opens up a number of new and exciting questions.

<p>
All animals behave, and behavior is crucial for organisms responding to varied
and unpredictable environments. As a continuous process, the algorithms by
which animals make behavioural decisions may have been optimised by natural
selection ever since what we call behaviour first emerged.  How can we examine
such 'behavioural algorithms'?  Animal behavior can be conceptualized as a
series of distinct states. For instance, consider a meerkat that lies down for
10 minutes, briefly stands up for 20 seconds, then starts moving around for
another 7.5 minutes searching for food. Such patterns are known as the
'behavioral sequences' of an animal.  Understanding shared properties that
apply to behavioural sequences across species can give us new insights into
animal behavioural algorithms.
</p>
<p>

To address questions like these, we need data about animal behavioural
sequences---we need to know what animals were doing and when, over long
continuous time periods.  Traditional methods involve researchers following
focal animals and recording their behaviours manually, but such methods can
become prohibitively taxing, dangerous, and expensive as more and more animals
are followed in their natural habitats.  Our research involved fieldwork, where
we gathered behavioral data using multi-sensor collars equipped with
accelerometers combined with advanced machine learning methods. Accelerometers
measure posture and movement changes, and when analyzed with machine learning
techniques, they can accurately predict animal activities. This approach
allowed us to capture detailed behavioral sequences lasting several days to
weeks from multiple individuals across three distinct species.
</p>
<p>

Initially, we anticipated significant differences in behaviors due to distinct
ecological roles and environments of hyenas, meerkats, and coatis.
Surprisingly, we found universal patterns in how these animals transition
between behaviors, regardless of species or individual.
</p>
<p>

For example, imagine a hyena walking continuously for 10 minutes. You might
wonder whether the chance it will switch behaviors in the next second increases
or decreases with more time spent walking. Our analysis revealed a striking
result: the longer an animal continues a behavior, the less likely it becomes
to switch immediately afterward. This was unexpected; we originally thought the
probability of switching behaviors would increase over time, as we assumed it
would not be optimal to 'lock-in' to any behaviour. Remarkably, this kind of
lock-in (also called a 'decreasing hazard function') was consistent across all
studied animals and species.
</p>
<p>

We further examined how current behavior predicts future actions at various
timescales---a concept we call "predictivity decay." Predictivity decay
reflects the increasing difficulty in predicting behavior the further we look
into the future, primarily due to random, unpredictable variations.  The shape
of the decay graph conveys how decision-making systems across different
timescales interact to generate animals' behavioural sequences.  We found that
the pattern of predictivity decay was remarkably consistent across all animals
studied, suggesting common, fundamental principles might govern animal behavior
universally.
</p>
<p>

Our study raises several big questions--- Why do such patterns occur, and how
widespread are they?  We propose two explanations for our results, considering
them a general property either of behaviour itself or of how behaviour
intersects with environmental variability.  For our explanations and more
details, please explore our full research paper.  A lot more is left to be
found, and several new scientific studies can stem from this work.  This study
and subsequent follow-ups can lead to a better elucidation of the behavioural
algorithms of animals.

<h3>Influence networks in cichlids and meerkats</h3>
<p class="project-para">
Which animals in social groups influence the behaviours of their conspecifics?
What is the mechanism of behavioural influence?
Does being influential/non-influential show as patterns in an individual's behavioural sequences?
In this project, I will look at data from cichlids and meerkats to answer these questions.

<h3>Spotted hyena accelerometry analyses</h3>
<p class="project-para">
During my master's, I developed a classifier that uses accelerometer data to quantify behavioural states of spotted hyenas.
Machine learning methods are often criticised for being uninterpretable, and consequently unreliable.
This study takes a very cautious, rigorous approach to this analysis, with many sanity checks to make sure what we are saying is sensible.
We then use the classifier's predictions to ask what factors affect hyena activity patterns, of which the most interesting factor tested is social synchrony.

<h3>Mixed species trails</h3>
<p>
Surprisingly, when one studies Animal Behaviour, they think a lot about plants. 
It isn't really very surprsing, given that plants are food for so many animals. 
What most people neglect to consider is that plants can be bloody irritating to move through; 
especially thorny invasives like Lantana camara. In this project, I collected data from the 
Biligiri Ranganathaswamy Wildlife Sancturary, and performed extensive quantitative analyses on them. 
Also, lots of cool Agent Based Modelling!

<h3>Blackbuck collective behaviour</h3>
<p>
There are colonial legends of herds of blackbuck that stretched across 
swathes of land so large that you could not see the boundaries of the herd when standing in the middle. 
Sadly, the blackbuck is now critically endangered, and its largest groups today number around a paltry... 
seven hundred?! How are blackbuck groups so large? How do you quantify groups? 
What is the meaning of a group size?

<h3>Risk-reward decisions</h3>
<p>
What if I told you that converting the entire habitat of an animal to a reserve is 
probably not the best idea for conserving that animal? What if there exists an optimal 
proportion of area to protect? In this highly exploratory project, I have mentored an 
undergraduate student, Ananya Passi, 
who has come up with fascinating insights using a mathematical modelling approach.
